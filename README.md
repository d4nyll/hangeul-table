# hangeul-table

> The official language of Korea (both South Korea and North Korea) is **[Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language)**, which uses **[Hangeul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul)** (**한글**, sometimes written as **Hangul**) as its **[writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system)** writing system. Literally, 'Han' (한) means 'Korean', and 'Gul' (글) means 'letter' or 'script'.

`hangeul-table` is a grid showing all Hangeul vowels, consonants, and their combined 2-character syllable blocks.
